        <p class="c4"><span class="c0 c1">Are we too hard on Big Brother?</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the novel </span><span class="c0 c11">1984</span><span class="c0 c1">, George
            Orwell envisions a world devoid of privacy and individuality, where the political party, Ingsoc, constantly
            monitors everyone. In the story, the population is aware it is being watched and is held in check by the
            fear of intense punishment whenever they even slightly step out of line. In the real world, it would be
            difficult for any party or organization to reach this power level without facing severe resistance from
            citizens. However, if an organization were to watch people without their knowledge or consent, they could
            potentially gain Orwellian levels of power unbeknownst to the general population.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1">Some fear this is the goal of prominent technology corporations in the digital
            age. As companies develop powerful methods of utilizing data to fulfill their desires, the value and power
            of data as an asset continue to expand. At the beginning of 2024, Reddit announced that it was selling
            access to its collection of user-generated data to several large artificial intelligence companies,
            including Google (Dave). This transaction is just one instance of data&rsquo;s transformation into a weapon
            companies pay hundreds of millions for. Technology corporations are claiming the content that users create
            on their platforms as company property that can be sold for profit.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1">Furthermore, not only is user content part of transactions but users&#39; personal
            information as well. This includes simple data points such as names or email addresses, but also behavioral
            information that can be harnessed by advertisers and algorithms to maximize profits by manipulating the
            thoughts and actions of users. In this paper, &ldquo;Facebook&rdquo; will refer to both the social media
            platform and its parent company known formerly as Facebook, which switched its name to &ldquo;Meta&rdquo; in
            2021. Two decades after its creation, Facebook continues to receive criticism from users and regulators
            about its inability to handle data responsibly. Facebook has faced countless privacy controversies, and the
            Federal Trade Commission has taken action against Facebook several times in response to failures to protect
            the privacy of its users (Federal Trade Commission). With the exponential growth of artificial intelligence
            technology and a population that is unmindful of the extent to which companies have access to their data,
            technology companies such as Facebook may soon obtain greater power over its users than Ingsoc over its
            citizens, without them even realizing they are under the control of these companies.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">A portion of the population is aware of the looming digital threats to privacy, and
            there are discussions concerning the necessary tradeoff between user privacy and the benefits of online
            services. Facebook has three different categories of privacy settings that users can enable to customize
            their level of protection, including information, accessibility, and expressive privacy. These settings
            reduce users&rsquo; visibility on the platform, which interferes with the primary function of Facebook as an
            effective tool for building and maintaining social relationships (</span><span
                class="c6">Vishwanath)</span><span class="c0">. The success and popularity of Facebook are evidence that
                    users benefit from sacrificing some of their privacy on the platform. This claim is backed by research that
                    shows that Facebook has tangible benefits, including enhancing social interaction and possibly being
                    &ldquo;beneficial to students experiencing low self-esteem and low life satisfaction&rdquo; (</span><span
                        class="c6">Johnston).</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1">Various debates have been sparked by the cost-benefit tradeoff of low digital
            privacy. For example, in the 2023 article &ldquo;Can Human Rights Survive Technology?&rdquo; Laura Belmonte
            voiced her concern that technology would eliminate several human rights, including the right to privacy. She
            warns that we constantly provide many organizations with data about &ldquo;our health, our internet use, our
            financial history, our political views, our families and friends, and more,&rdquo; often without our
            knowledge. Belmonte is aware of a technology-enabled path our society can take to a complete lack of privacy
            and individuality, as foretold by George Orwell. However, it is still crucial to spread this message beyond
            the scholarly community so that the general public can also become mindful of the extent to which its data
            can be accessed and misused. By becoming aware of the data they willingly give up to public and private
            organizations, users can take a step toward maintaining their digital privacy. However, there is still a
            missing piece to this solution that very few writers have directly addressed.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1">Reading the fine print will not stop Ingsoc from watching you sleep. Both public
            organizations and private companies have developed technology that enables them to conduct digital
            surveillance without the knowledge of those being monitored. Belmonte and others do acknowledge the fact
            that these methods of data collection do exist, from corporate surveillance of employees to software such as
            Pegasus, which &ldquo;gives the operator access to the microphone, camera, GPS data, passwords, audio and
            visual recordings, email, and voicemails on the unsuspecting user&rsquo;s infected phone&rdquo;
            (Belmonte).</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1">The question that remains to be answered is to what extent the companies
            themselves are responsible for ensuring their users&#39; privacy. This requires considering several aspects
            of privacy, including the security of user data, who has access to the data, and what is done with the data.
            The parties involved in the question of the digital responsibilities of companies include the users of the
            online products, the companies themselves, which consist of the corporate leadership and the employees of
            the company, and the lawmakers with the power to place regulations on the companies. Each party has a
            different perspective on the issue and a unique set of abilities to influence the situation based on their
            motives. The rest of this paper will discuss these perspectives and how they relate to the three aspects of
            privacy and will discuss Facebook specifically, although the ideas apply to most modern technology and
            internet companies.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1">The first group of people is the users of Facebook. In theory, a rational consumer
            is motivated to maximize their utility. In the context of Facebook, it means they want to maximize the value
            they get from Facebook while limiting the associated negative consequences or costs. In the context of data
            privacy, the primary concern of users is that companies will use their data in some way that will harm them.
            This harm can come in many forms, as data can be used by malicious or ignorant organizations in a multitude
            of ways. If a Facebook user&rsquo;s address is leaked to the wrong people, it could put them in physical
            danger by revealing their location. A data leak could also put a user at risk for financial harm if the leak
            leads to them losing money. Beyond the potential for harm, many users do not want any corporation or
            organization to have access to their details.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1">However, customers also benefit from the sharing and utilization of their data. By
            turning off Facebook&rsquo;s privacy settings, they open themselves up to more functions of the site and the
            potential for greater gains while using it. These gains include meeting new people online or maintaining
            existing relationships. Facebook can also use customers&rsquo; data to optimize their experience while using
            the platform by suggesting tailor-made content to increase entertainment. This increases the enjoyment users
            get out of the site but also increases the health risks associated with using Facebook. Additionally,
            sharing user data both within the website and externally can lead to the threats discussed previously.
            Another benefit for some users of Facebook is the ability for researchers to utilize it to gather data for
            studies, but this leads to another set of ethical debates that will not be discussed in further detail in
            this paper. In general, it is ideal for customer data to be the least accessible as possible, and to limit
            the usage of this data to mainly improving the social aspect of the platform.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1">Another party involved in the dilemma of digital privacy is Facebook as a company.
            There are many different types of people involved in Facebook, but the three groups that privacy is
            especially relevant to are the leaders, the legal teams, and the platform&#39;s developers. The leaders are
            responsible for making large-scale decisions related to privacy. The developers are responsible for
            implementing those decisions in the application itself, and for making sure that data is stored and
            transferred securely and effectively. The legal teams are responsible for confirming that both the decisions
            and implementations align with the law. Legal teams also must put together documents such as terms and
            conditions to communicate these decisions relating to data privacy.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1">Facebook is a firm in a competitive market and is thus primarily motivated by
            profits. However, this also means they must maintain relationships with their customers and lawmakers to
            avoid unnecessary legal or social pushback, which could affect their profits. This incentivizes companies to
            keep the best interests of their customers in mind, as upsetting users by misusing their data could lead to
            people leaving the platform. However, lawmakers and users must decide if this is enough motivation for
            Facebook to protect its users or if more actions are necessary to keep them in check.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1">I believe that there should be regulations concerning the ethical use of data, but
            they should be limited in the ways they restrict companies from using data. Companies should be required to
            protect users from any type of harm, and there should be strong regulations or bans on collecting data
            without people&rsquo;s knowledge. Additionally, Facebook should be held responsible for any actions of
            companies or individuals to whom they provide user data, and users should provide consent for their data to
            be shared with an organization other than Facebook. However, if data is willingly given up by a user on the
            website itself, Facebook has a right to utilize that data to increase its profits and make technological
            advancements, such as training artificial intelligence models on it.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ultimately, it is up to lawmakers to put together regulations that consider the
            wants, needs, and rights of both consumers and businesses in the digital world. Concerning ethics, they need
            to consider the accessibility and usage of users&rsquo; data. They also need to be sure to not protect
            privacy so much to the point that technological advancements are slowed down or prevented, as this would be
            to the detriment of society as a whole. This issue affects almost every single person in modern society, and
            each of them will have a slightly different opinion on the subject. However, we must all agree that the
            balance between privacy and benefits is practically equivalent to the balance between preventing
            technological advancements and submitting to constant surveillance and manipulation by the &ldquo;Big
            Brothers&rdquo; of the technology industry. It is crucial to not only be mindful of this balance but to come
            to a consensus on the requirements to be placed on corporations, so that lawmakers, Facebook, and its users
            can find the equilibrium between privacy and freedom and create a more optimal world.</span>
